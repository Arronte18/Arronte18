### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am Anthony Arronte Lugo, a dedicated undergraduate student at the University of Central Florida set to graduate in Spring 2024 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. Proficient in programming languages such as C, Java, and Python, as well as web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have hands-on experience with REACT, REACT Native, and databases such as MySQL and MongoDB.

Currently immersed in my Senior Design Capstone project, I am leading the development of an innovative Unreal Engine application in collaboration with the Florida Space Institute and NASA. This project involves creating a simulation space based on telemetry data, aiming to provide a valuable resource for students and professionals alike. Through this endeavor, we aspire to facilitate the modeling and testing of data in various scenarios, contributing to advancements in the field of simulation technology.
